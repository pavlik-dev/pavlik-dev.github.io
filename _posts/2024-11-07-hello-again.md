Global update:  
Not only my website was transfered to Cloudflare, but I also found a way to use this site without JS and cookies!  

#### What does that mean?

Now you can use this website with browsers like Dillo, w3m, and even curl, **and even plain telnet!**

#### Is it legal? (not against InfinityFree's ToU)

I don't know... InfinityFree is intended as a **website** hosting, so I guess it's not.  
But I think this is fine because I'm not planning to host any files/APIs.  
For this purpose I moved all my icons, images, screenshots to GitHub.  
**static.pavliktt.pp.ua is a GitHub Pages website.**

#### Why?

Browsers that don't support JS **and** cookies won't be able to access my website.
