Finally I made a guest book!\
I wrote code quickly when I was in computer science class at school instead of doing what I was assigned. :3\
And I finally fixed the bug that caused GET parameters not to work ;)

#### Coming soon

I want to make a simple HTTPS-to-HTTP proxy. Don't expect it to work perfectly though!
