title: finfo 1.0 released!
---

After four months since the initial commit,
finfo has finally reached a stable state,
marking the release of version 1.0!

## Changelog

1. **statx Support on Linux**\
   finfo now uses statx on Linux, which means...
   file creation dates are finally here!\
   **Note:** finfo now needs at least Linux 4.11 and glibc 2.28.

2. **Detailed View**\
   The detailed view now shows extra fields from `stat` (or `statx`)
   and includes milliseconds in the dates (if supported).

3. **Better Windows & macOS Support**\
   finfo now checks your platform to make sure it gets the values right on Windows and macOS.

4. **New File Class, Totally Rewritten**\
   finfo is now mainly a library, with the CLI tool just a wrapper around it.

5. **No More Subfields, Just Delimiters**\
   Subfields got messy, so I switched to using delimiters instead.

## Todo
 - Bring unsupported fields to Windows! (at least the file owner field)
