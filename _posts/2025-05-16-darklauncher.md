Soo, 2 days ago, May 14, I started making my own launcher.

As you can probably tell, the project is still developing, although still you can surely daily-use it.

Dark Launcher is a very simple launcher, no wallpapers (yet), no Google search, you don't have any of that fancy
stuff a lot of popular launchers do. Just you and your app list, search bar, current date and time.\
Yeah, its called Dark Launcher but it is only when you have dark mode turned on. (I'll definitely work on that in
1.2.0, promise)

But hey, at least its small af. The app takes up only around 8 MB.\
For reference, Google's Calculator app weights 1.7 megaby- oh...

Uh, anyways, the source code is available, as well as prebuilt APKs. Enjoy!
