# Hi! My name is Pavel
*aka: pavlik_tt, pavlik_roblox, zigzag14, etc.*

I'm a retrocoding enthusiast who loves building crazy projects.\
Since I started learning programming at 8, I've done a lot of different things. *(I didn't say useful btw)*

I'm good at Python and currently learning Golang.\
I do know C and C++ but I'm bad at it.

I did some useful things like
  - [finfo](https://github.com/pavlik-dev/finfo/) &mdash; A simple C++ utility that displays information about files

And even crazy things like
  - [minCPU](mincpu/) &mdash; A virtual CPU family, 8, 16 *and 32-bit soon* versions available.
  - SerialGPT &mdash; ChatGPT over serial (COM) port
