<p style="text-align:center">*One day I wanted to make my own processor... and I did!*</p>

* [Instruction table](insttable/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mincpu/)

## About
minCPU is a CPU that's fairly easy to learn.\
The instruction set is mostly empty, however
you still can run impressive stuff on here. (maybe)\
Everything is 16-bit, and by that I mean opcodes,
arguments and memory, everything is 16-bit. (at least in minCPU-16)

## Versions
*Note: minCPU-16 instruction table and syntax is completely different from minCPU-8. minCPU-8 programs will not work on minCPU-16.*
 * minCPU-16 (16-bit)\
   GitLab: [mincpu/mincpu-16](https://gitlab.com/mincpu/mincpu-16)
 * minCPU-8 (8-bit, not maintained)\
   GitLab: [mincpu/mincpu-8](https://gitlab.com/mincpu/mincpu-8)

## minASM
Assembler dialect for minCPU (kinda obvious)
 * minASM-8\
   GitLab: [mincpu/minasm-8](https://gitlab.com/mincpu/minasm-8)
