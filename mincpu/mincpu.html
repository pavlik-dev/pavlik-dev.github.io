<h2>About</h2>
minCPU is a CPU that's fairly easy to learn.<br />
The instruction set is mostly empty, however
you still can run impressive stuff on here. (maybe)<br />
Everything is 16-bit, and by that I mean opcodes,
arguments and memory, everything is 16-bit. (at least in minCPU-16)

<h2>Versions</h2>
<i>Note: minCPU-16 instruction table and syntax is completely different from minCPU-8. minCPU-8 programs will not work
  on
  minCPU-16.</i>
<h4>minCPU-16</h4>
<p>
  Built from scratch on the experience already gained, 16-bit, has functions.<br />

</p>
<h4>minCPU-8</h4>
<p>
  The very first in the family, terrible in terms of functionality, runs on Python, <b>no longer maintained.</b><br />

<h2>minASM</h2>
Assembler dialect for minCPU (kinda obvious)
<h4>minASM-8</h4>
<p>
  No labels
